The final mAP result showed in the presentation is wrong. 
This is an error that was detected only after the due date 
of the 4th assignment and fixed only in the version 2 of the detector
delivered for the final report (5th assignment).
However, we already explained that our v1 detector was so slow that
we couldn't finish to process all the images, and that the final result 
of the experiment was a failure.
