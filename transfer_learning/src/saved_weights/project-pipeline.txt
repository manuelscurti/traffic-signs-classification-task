- take a pretrained models from keras.layers
- train the net (using data augmentation) and save the weights (so that you don't lose time)
- use the trained model as a feature extractor, to 
	extract features from train,val,test sets
- use the new datasets to train a fully connected net from scratch
  without using data augmentation
